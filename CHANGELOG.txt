2021-07-TODO:
 - Replace "real_multiplier" block with DSP-Macro in Tx output amplitude
 - Remove floating point converter?
 - Check FIR overflow (sum(coeff) > 1)
 - increase FIR output bitwidth beyond 24 bits, we got the space
 - remove (unneeded) data width converter (24->24) in rx chain

2021-08-02 PL:
 - Added DMA Controller and connected back the AXIS reader, widths might have been changed?
 - removed xilinx.com:ip:axis_data_fifo:2.0 apparently
 - Changed RX DDS output to 16 bit: additional changes
 - rxstatus register must n*AXI_DATA_WIDTH: now 32 bits, added concat
 - renamed slice blocks for more clarity which bits go where

2021-07-15 PL:
 - Changed RX DDS output to 16 bit (cannot go higher with 30 bit phase, new?)
 - Snif dds output, removed fifo on sniffer dac1
 - renamed RxConfig registers slices with bit slice
 - connect dcm_locked to ps system reset block
 - removed EMIO: GPIO SPI0 TTC0 from PS
 
2021-07-15 nmr-server:
 - set defaults in main.cpp, nmrcore no longer configs mmaps with a default
 - add toggle TxReset loop

2021-07-12 nmr-server:
 - Makefile for remote building, set date, upload bit
 - Reduced RxReset time from 1 sec to 1 msec
 - Fix SLCR (un)lock register address, was wrong
 - no longer config clock on startup
 - add reset reg write to reset PL (crashes 2nd time)
 - Add getopt() argument handling for force_on, reset, no server, test pulse etc

2021-05-21 PL:
 - mult_0 (mixer) output width 26->24 (error?)
 - propagate this through: bcast_0, sniffer_0, axis_subset_converter_0, axis_subset_converter_1
 - fir_0 output width 26->24 (also error?)
 - 
 - removed Output attenuator multiplier real_multiplier_0 for now as I have no idea if this works
 - 
 
2021-05-19 nmr-server:
 - nmr-server: project converted to Vitis
 - nmr-server: Added (simple) support for BlankLen, now only set to 100us

2021-05-19 PL:
 - Packaged NMRPulseSequencer(.v) as an IP core
 - Added blank signal to NMRPulseSequencer
 - Added BlankLen to txconfig register in PL
 - Added set Blank len command to protocol

2021-05-12:
 - xdc: ADC pins added, new RP ADC core with data_width=14 (Pavel update)
 - xdc: DAC port dac_data_o: set SLEW_FAST to SLEW_SLOW and DRIVE 8->4
 - xdc: add ports: Vp_Vn_v_*, Vaux*, exp_n_tri_io[], daisy* 
 - Updated Red Pitaya ADC core to Pavels (v3) version: clk removed, 16 bit support)
 	ADC v3: clk to PLL, to DAC with two phases, to logic instead of local 143MHz
 - Updated Red Pitaya DAC core to Pavels (v2) version:
	DAC v2: add wrt_clk, SAME_EDGE, switched D1/D2 data lines around
 - Added Clocking wizard to generate 125, 250_a, 250_b clocks for adc core and DAC ports 
 - added exp_p/m_tri_io ports, connected to sync, pulse_on (n = inverted)
 - removed heartbeat leds, connected leds to exp_p.. port, same order
 - removed from src and auto-generated _wrapper.v
 - upstream cores(tvr): update Stream Reader, Config reg, Status reg, Stream Variable

2021-04-29:
 - Vivado/Vitis 2020.2 under Linux conversion

2020-10-21:
 - Vivado 2020.1
 - Route Tx output through multiplier

2019-05-28:
 - Rx Mixer output back to 24 bits (copied from old project), but left the data width converter out, float converter works with all 26 bits from FIR

2019-05-20:
 - Switched to GIT
 - Switched to .tcl project control
 - Added amplitude control
 - Switched FIFO to Stream FIFO in Rx
 - Switched to xilinx-cores for known cores
 ! Changed Rx Mixer output width to 32-bits and kept this width until the float converter
 - Reset both DDS on Tx/RxReset to sync phase

2017-05-29:
 - Client: All times to clks with 142.8 MHz/10 clk
 - client-ui: increased A-width and B-width decimals to 1
 - nmr-server: renamed usec to clks in nmrcore.cpp
 - nmr-server: Alen, Blen 32bits
 - nmr-server: version = 20170529
 - Added phase adjust to client (PlotWidget and MainWindow)
 - Changed scaling of PlotTimeWidget
 - Removed (non-functional) Qt4 support, it useless
 - Updated env (pyqt5 more clean, matplotlib looks better)

2017-05-24:
 - incr. Alen, Blen width to 32 bits
 - set pulse_gen divider to 14 instead of 143
