 - Vivado 2020.1
 - Route Tx output through multiplier

2019-05-28:
 - Rx Mixer output back to 24 bits (copied from old project), but left the data width converter out, float converter works with all 26 bits from FIR

2019-05-20:
 - Switched to GIT
 - Switched to .tcl project control
 - Added amplitude control
 - Switched FIFO to Stream FIFO in Rx
 - Switched to xilinx-cores for known cores
 ! Changed Rx Mixer output width to 32-bits and kept this width until the float converter
 - Reset both DDS on Tx/RxReset to sync phase
 

2017-05-29:
 - Client: All times to clks with 142.8 MHz/10 clk
 - client-ui: increased A-width and B-width decimals to 1
 - nmr-server: renamed usec to clks in nmrcore.cpp
 - nmr-server: Alen, Blen 32bits
 - nmr-server: version = 20170529
 - Added phase adjust to client (PlotWidget and MainWindow)
 - Changed scaling of PlotTimeWidget
 - Removed (non-functional) Qt4 support, it useless
 - Updated env (pyqt5 more clean, matplotlib looks better)

2017-05-24:
 - incr. Alen, Blen width to 32 bits
 - set pulse_gen divider to 14 instead of 143
