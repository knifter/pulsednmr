2021-05-TODO:
 - Replace config/status registers core which supports >32bits (suspected bug in old version)
 - Convert NMRPulseGenerator to packaged IP in localcores
 - Add blank signal to NMRPulseGenerator

2021-05-12:
 - xdc: ADC pins added, new RP ADC core with data_width=14 (Pavel update)
 - xdc: DAC port dac_data_o: set SLEW_FAST to SLEW_SLOW and DRIVE 8->4
 - xdc: add ports: Vp_Vn_v_*, Vaux*, exp_n_tri_io[], daisy* 
 - Updated Red Pitaya ADC core to Pavels (v3) version: clk removed, 16 bit support)
 	ADC v3: clk to PLL, to DAC with two phases, to logic instead of local 143MHz
 - Updated Red Pitaya DAC core to Pavels (v2) version:
	DAC v2: add wrt_clk, SAME_EDGE, switched D1/D2 data lines around
 - Added Clocking wizard to generate 125, 250_a, 250_b clocks for adc core and DAC ports 
 - added exp_p/m_tri_io ports, connected to sync, pulse_on (n = inverted)
 - removed heartbeat leds, connected leds to exp_p.. port, same order
 - removed from src and auto-generated _wrapper.v
 - upstream cores(tvr): update Stream Reader, Config reg, Status reg, Stream Variable

2021-04-29:
 - Vivado/Vitis 2020.2 under Linux conversion

2020-10-21:
 - Vivado 2020.1
 - Route Tx output through multiplier

2019-05-28:
 - Rx Mixer output back to 24 bits (copied from old project), but left the data width converter out, float converter works with all 26 bits from FIR

2019-05-20:
 - Switched to GIT
 - Switched to .tcl project control
 - Added amplitude control
 - Switched FIFO to Stream FIFO in Rx
 - Switched to xilinx-cores for known cores
 ! Changed Rx Mixer output width to 32-bits and kept this width until the float converter
 - Reset both DDS on Tx/RxReset to sync phase
 

2017-05-29:
 - Client: All times to clks with 142.8 MHz/10 clk
 - client-ui: increased A-width and B-width decimals to 1
 - nmr-server: renamed usec to clks in nmrcore.cpp
 - nmr-server: Alen, Blen 32bits
 - nmr-server: version = 20170529
 - Added phase adjust to client (PlotWidget and MainWindow)
 - Changed scaling of PlotTimeWidget
 - Removed (non-functional) Qt4 support, it useless
 - Updated env (pyqt5 more clean, matplotlib looks better)

2017-05-24:
 - incr. Alen, Blen width to 32 bits
 - set pulse_gen divider to 14 instead of 143
